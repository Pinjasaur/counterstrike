# CS:GO

CS:GO config.

I wouldn't recommend copy-pasting verbatim -- cherry-picking is likely more effective -- but YMMV. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I also run with the following launch options: `-nojoy -nod3d9ex -novid -tickrate 128 -freq 144 -language bananagaming`.

## Installation

The `.cfg`s must go in `{STEAM}/userdata/{USER_ID}/730/local/cfg`. Given this setup, `autoexec.cfg` should automatically be executed.
